some usefull scripts to automate building NanoCheeZe from source
I used a home directory of /home/rqn842. Modify as required for
your environment

get_depends - a lot of apt-get install for dependancys
build_nc - clones the git repo into ~ and builds the daemon , nanocheezed
build_qt - builds the GUI interfae NanoCheeze-qt
build_win64 - TBD build .exe's for Windoze
sed_it - the global sed's that converted HoboNickels to NanoCheeZe
